Class Pedometer:

    The constructor __init__ sets the date and initializes the step count to 0.
    The method incrementSteps increases the step count by 1.
    The method __str__ returns the formatted string output.

Test Program:

    For each object, the steps are simulated by repeatedly calling incrementSteps.
    The results are printed by calling print, which internally calls __str__.
